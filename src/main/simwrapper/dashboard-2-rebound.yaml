  title: Short- and long-term effects of AVs and ACVs
  description: "This page shows the potential effects when introducing automated (AVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (ACVs),
                together with intelligent infrastructure uniformly and unrestricted to the scenario. We simulated short-term effects by only allowing agents
                to adapt their plans by re-routing and departure time mutation. Long-term effects also includes mode-choice behaviour."
