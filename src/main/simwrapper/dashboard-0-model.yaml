    This dashboards shows an overview and some key insights into the Düsseldorf MATSim scenario available at https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-duesseldorf
    , a transport model for Düsseldorf, provided by the Transport Systems Planning and Transport Telematics group of Technische Universität Berlin.
    This model has been used within the KoMoDnext project, but is all model code and data is openly available and can be used for further transportation study research.
