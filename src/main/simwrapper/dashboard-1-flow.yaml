  title: "Effect of AVs on flow capacity"
  description: "This dashboard shows the effect of conventional vehicles (CV), automated vehicles (AV) and highly autonomous vehicles (ACV) on flow capacity.
                We modeled the driving behaviour microscopically in SUMO and evaluated for intersections in the study area."
