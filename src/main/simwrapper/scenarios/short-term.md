The following table shows the reduction in time spent for traveling in car:

|                | Near fut. &nbsp;  | Mid-term &nbsp; | Distant fut. &nbsp;
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Vehicle-hours  |  +x.x%  | -x.x% |  -x.x%   |

The overall numbers of car trips stayed the same, because mode-choice was not enabled.
This assumption is not plausible for scenarios in the future, but shows the effect, if nobody switched to a different mode.
